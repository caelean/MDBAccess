NDN MongoDB Web Access System Project


This Project was done in High School, as I was working as an intern at UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering,
in the Graduate Computer Science Department. I worked under Professor Lixia Zhang as a part of the Internet Research
Lab. This code was modified by me to create a working web page that could communicate with PyServer.
